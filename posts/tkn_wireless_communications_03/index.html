The received Waveform(Path 2 ) is
The aggregate Waveform received at the receiver is +</p><p>The time difference between the delays of the two paths called

so that is 2fc/v=Ds
and the and when time changes by 1/2Ds, wave changes from peak to vally</p><p>Coherence time is 1/Ds
The Time scale is the time when reaching the obvious change of compares the original one, so at this moment is r0=vt
$\sin\left(2\pi f(\frac{vt}{c}+\frac{r_{o}-d}{c})\right)$
$T_d$ may result in Inter-sysmbol interference
even destruct the transmitt</p><p>The slide notes that if the signal frequency $f$ changes by as little as $1/(2T_d)$, the channel can shift from constructive (a peak) to destructive interference (a valley)</p><p>So we define the Coherence Bandwidth</p><p>##Diversity
whats
sending same bit daa through different paths to mitigate fading effects
how
Time diversity
Space
Frequency
Polarization
type(variants)
Receive diversity
Send diversity
Cooperative Relaying</p><p>###diversity combining(receiver diversity)
####sc selective combining
####equal gain combining(cophased and same rate)
####Maximal Ration Combining(cophased and weight(SNR)adjusted )
###transmit diversity
####when having channel info similar to receiver diversity
####not having channel info, Alamouti scheme
#
##Frequency selective fading
why according to the Ws=1/Td, the channel quality will drop when among a scale, so we need to spread spectrum to average the loss
how
###DSSS(Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
(Low rate -> less bit one sec, high rate -> more bit in one sec
High rate results in higher bandwith(frequency scale) )
Xor user_data every bit dauert t_b and a Chipping sequence(fake random sequence)every
so we get a higher bandwidth</p><p>###FHSS(Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=https://muzhi-hac.github.io/muzhi777.github.io/tags/wireless/ class="link f5 grow br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif no-underline">Wireless</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=https://muzhi-hac.github.io/muzhi777.github.io/tags/kubernetes/ class="link f5 grow br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif no-underline">Kubernetes</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=https://muzhi-hac.github.io/muzhi777.github.io/tags/lab/ class="link f5 grow br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif no-underline">Lab</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=https://muzhi-hac.github.io/muzhi777.github.io/posts/kubernetes-getting-started/>Kubernetes 入门指南</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://muzhi-hac.github.io/muzhi777.github.io/>&copy; Helloworld 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
