The Transmitted Waveform is
and the received Waveform(Path 1) is
The received Waveform(Path 2 ) is
The aggregate Waveform received at the receiver is +&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time difference between the delays of the two paths called
Delay Spread($T_d$)
and the and when time changes by 1/Td, wave changes from peak to vally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doppler spread is the difference of the two paths frequency
so that is 2fc/v=Ds
and the and when time changes by 1/2Ds, wave changes from peak to vally&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
